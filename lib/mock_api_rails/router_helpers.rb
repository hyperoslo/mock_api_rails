    # Mock APIs
    #
    # mocking apis can be really useful to get a quick idea of how the api
    # should work, in order to add a mock of an api you call:
    #
    # mock_api http_method, url, status (optional)
    #
    # - http_method: get, put, patch, delete, post, etc.
    # - url: the url which will be appended to /api
    # - status (optional): the desired status code response
    #
    # then **it's very important** to place the reponse body in a json file on
    # the `api_mocks` directory, the name is automatically infered from the
    # http_method and url of the mocked api
    #
    # Example:
    #
    #   mock_api :get, '/groups/:group_id/users/:id', status: 203
    #
    #   will automatically look for the file
    #
    #     `api_mocks/get_groups_group_id_users_id.json`
    #
    #   in order to provide the appropiate response
    def mock_api(method, path, options = {})
      options[:method] = method
      options[:path]   = path
      send(method, path, to: 'mocks#show', mock_data: options)
    end
  end
end
